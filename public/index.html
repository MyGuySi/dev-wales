    <h1>Building an inclusive community for Developers in Wales</h1>
    <p> We believe that any inclusive community should be open and accessible to everyone. That's why we're creating one place where you can find everything you need to get involved and discover new opportunities.</p>

    <h1>How to get started</h1>

    <h2>Get involved in the community</h2>
    <p>Join one of the local <a href="./groups.html">groups</a>. If you’re interested in giving a talk then join our <a href="./speakers.html">speakers</a> list so that organisers can find you.</p>

    <h2>Find work as a developer</h2>
    <p>Search for <a href="./jobs.html">jobs</a> or contact <a href="./companies.html">companies</a> directly. If you’re a contractor, advertise your services on the <a href="./companies.html">companies</a> list.</p>

    <h2>Recruit developers for your company</h2>
    <p>First make sure you’re on our list on <a href="./companies.html">companies</a> then add a listing to <a href="./jobs.html">jobs</a>. The <a href="./companies.html">companies</a> also list includes contractors that you can reach out to.</p>

    <h2>Organise a group</h2>
    <p>If you organise a meetup or user group make sure you’re on the <a href="./groups.html">groups</a> list. Reach out to <a href="./speakers.html">speakers</a> and invite them talk at your events.</p>
