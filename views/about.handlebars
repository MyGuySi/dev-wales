    <h1>About this site</h1>

    <p class="mt-8 leading-normal">Hey, thanks for stopping by! This site was build and run by me, Simon Anthony. My
      hope is that you can use it to find companies in Wales that employ software developers along with some jobs that
      are currently open.</p>

    <p class="mt-8 leading-normal">If you have any questions you can <a class="text-red" href="https://twitter.com/myguysi">find
        me on Twitter</a> or shoot me a DM on the <a class="text-red" href="https://cardiffdev.herokuapp.com">Cardiff
        Dev Slack</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-8">Motivation</h2>

    <p class="mt-4 leading-normal">Back in September 2018 I lost my job while my wife and I were in the middle of
      saving for our first house so I had to find work pretty quickly. I started trawling job sites, local groups and
      visiting the websites of companies that I knew. I put together a spreadsheet to track the jobs I was interested
      in and updated my CV. The problem was, I don't actually know that many software companies based around South
      Wales even though I knew there were plenty of them.</p>

    <p class="mt-4 leading-normal">So that's why I started this project; to gather a list of companies in Wales that
      employ developers and give power back to job seekers to find the best places to work.</p>
